    "31) Suppose we have two continuous functions: $f: X \\rightarrow Y$ and $g: Y \\rightarrow Z$. This means that for any open neighbourhood $T$ of $z=g(y)\\in Z$ there exists an open neighbourhood $V$ of $y\\in Y$ such that $g(V\\cap Y)\\subset T$. Also for any neighbourhood $V$ of $y=f(x)\\in Y$ there exists an open neighbourhood $U$ of $x\\in X$ such that $f(U\\cap X)\\subset V$. Therefore, for any open neighbourhood $T$ of $z=g\\circ f(x)\\in Z$ there exists the open neighbourhood $U$ of $x\\in X$ such that $g\\circ f(U\\cap X)\\subset T$. Thus $g\\circ f$ is contnuous."
